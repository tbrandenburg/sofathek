# Feature: Add Agent Skill for PRP Core Workflow Runner

## Feature Description

Create an Agent Skill that orchestrates the complete PRP core workflow, automating the end-to-end process from feature request to pull request. This skill will execute the sequence: create branch → create PRP → execute PRP → commit → create PR, streamlining the development workflow for implementing new features using the PRP methodology.

## User Story

As a developer using the PRP framework
I want to run the complete PRP core workflow with a single invocation
So that I can quickly go from feature idea to pull request without manually executing each command

## Problem Statement

Currently, developers must manually execute 5 separate slash commands to complete the full PRP workflow:

1. `/prp-core-new-branch` - Create feature branch
2. `/prp-core-create` - Generate comprehensive PRP
3. `/prp-core-execute` - Implement the feature
4. `/prp-core-commit` - Commit changes
5. `/prp-core-pr` - Create pull request

This manual orchestration is:

- Time-consuming and error-prone
- Requires remembering the correct sequence
- Interrupts developer flow
- Not discoverable to new team members

## Solution Statement

Create an Agent Skill that Claude can autonomously invoke when a developer requests to implement a feature using the PRP workflow. The skill will:

- Automatically orchestrate all 5 PRP core commands in sequence
- Stop execution if any step fails
- Provide clear progress tracking
- Be discoverable through natural language requests
- Follow the existing command patterns and validation requirements

Additionally, create two supporting slash commands:

- `/prp-core-run-all` - Manually invoke the complete workflow
- `/prp-core-new-branch` - Create a conventional git branch (currently missing)

### Patterns to Follow

**Slash Command Structure** (from existing prp-core commands):

```markdown
---
description: 'Brief description of what this command does'
---

# Command Title

## Instructions

Step-by-step execution instructions...

## Report

Expected output format...
```

**SKILL.md Structure** (from Agent Skills documentation):

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-kebab-case
description: What the skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)
---

# Skill Name

## Instructions
Clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude

## Examples
Concrete usage examples
```

**Conventional Branch Naming** (standard practice):

- Prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `perf/`
- Format: `{prefix}/{kebab-case-description}`
- Max 50 characters
- Examples: `feat/add-user-auth`, `fix/login-redirect`

**Commit Message Format** (from PRP-core-commit.md):

```
<type>: <description>

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
Present tense, lowercase, 50 chars max, no period
NEVER mention Claude Code, Anthropic, or co-authoring
```

**Error Handling Pattern**:

- Stop execution if command fails
- Report which step failed clearly
- Provide actionable error message
- Don't proceed to next step on failure

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Foundation

Create the directory structure and supporting commands that the skill will orchestrate.

**Tasks:**

- Create `.claude/skills/prp-core-runner/` directory
- Create `/prp-core-new-branch` command for conventional branch creation

### Phase 2: Core Skill Implementation

Implement the main Agent Skill with proper metadata and instructions.

**Tasks:**

- Write SKILL.md with correct YAML frontmatter
- Define clear, step-by-step instructions for workflow orchestration
- Add error handling and validation requirements
- Include usage examples

### Phase 3: Integration

Ensure the skill integrates properly with existing PRP core commands.

**Tasks:**

- Verify skill can invoke SlashCommand tool
- Test error propagation from failed commands
- Validate command sequence execution
- Ensure proper reporting at each step

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

Test the complete workflow end-to-end.

**Tasks:**

- Manual test: Invoke skill with feature request
- Verify branch creation with conventional naming
- Confirm PRP creation and execution
- Validate commit and PR creation
- Test failure scenarios (e.g., test failures, validation errors)

---

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Tests

No unit tests required - this feature consists of configuration files and markdown templates.

### Integration Tests

Manual integration testing required to verify the complete workflow.

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Happy Path - Feature Implementation**
   - Invoke skill with feature request
   - Verify branch created with conventional name
   - Verify PRP created in `.claude/PRPs/features/`
   - Verify feature implementation completes
   - Verify commit created with conventional message
   - Verify PR created with proper description

2. **Failure Handling - Validation Error**
   - Trigger validation failure (e.g., introduce syntax error)
   - Verify workflow stops at failed step
   - Verify clear error message provided
   - Verify subsequent steps don't execute

3. **Skill Discovery**
   - Ask Claude "What skills are available?"
   - Verify prp-core-runner appears in list
   - Ask "Can you implement a feature using PRP?"
   - Verify Claude invokes the skill autonomously

### Edge Cases

1. **Branch Already Exists**: Verify -v2, -v3 suffixes work correctly
2. **Long Feature Names**: Verify truncation to 50 chars for branch names
3. **Special Characters in Feature**: Verify proper sanitization to kebab-case
4. **Existing Changes**: Verify behavior when working directory isn't clean
5. **Network Issues**: Verify proper error handling if PR creation fails

2. Verify Claude invokes prp-core-runner skill autonomously
3. Verify skill executes all workflow steps

**Test 3: Manual Command Invocation**

1. Run: `/prp-core-run-all Add logging to API endpoints`
2. Verify branch created with name like `feat/add-logging-to-api-endpoints`
3. Verify PRP created in `.claude/PRPs/features/add-logging-to-api-endpoints.md`
4. Verify subsequent steps execute in order

**Test 4: Branch Naming**

1. Run: `/prp-core-new-branch Fix authentication redirect bug`
2. Verify branch name: `fix/authentication-redirect-bug`
3. Run again with same name
4. Verify new branch: `fix/authentication-redirect-bug-v2`

## NOTES

### Design Decisions

**Why Agent Skill + Slash Commands?**

- Agent Skill provides autonomous invocation when Claude detects the user wants the full workflow
- Slash commands provide manual control for developers who want to run specific steps or the full sequence
- This dual approach supports both autonomous and manual workflows

**Why Separate new-branch Command?**

- Branch creation with conventional naming is reusable beyond PRP workflow
- Developers might want to create a branch without running the full workflow
- Follows single responsibility principle

**Branch Naming Convention Choices:**

- Used standard prefixes (feat/, fix/, etc.) for consistency with conventional commits
- Max 50 characters keeps branch names readable in terminal and git UIs
- Kebab-case is most common in git workflows and avoids URL encoding issues

**Error Handling Strategy:**

- Fail-fast approach: stop on first error to prevent cascading failures
- Clear error messages guide user to fix issues
- Don't try to auto-fix complex issues; report and let user decide

### Trade-offs

**Complexity vs. Flexibility:**

- Current design runs all 5 steps in sequence
- Alternative: Could allow running subset of steps
- Decision: Keep it simple - users can still run individual commands manually

**Discoverability vs. Specificity:**

- Skill description mentions "PRP workflow" specifically
- Alternative: More generic description like "automate feature development"
- Decision: Be specific so Claude knows exactly when to use it

**Validation Strictness:**

- Current design stops on any validation failure
- Alternative: Could try to continue with warnings
- Decision: Strict validation prevents shipping broken code

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Parallel PRP Creation**: Integrate with `/parallel-prp-creation` for exploring multiple approaches
2. **Review Integration**: Add optional `/prp-core-review` step before commit
3. **Configuration**: Allow customizing workflow steps via config file
4. **Rollback**: Add ability to undo workflow if late-stage validation fails
5. **Metrics**: Track workflow success rate and common failure points
6. **Templates**: Support different workflow templates for different project types
