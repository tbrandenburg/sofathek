# PRP Ralph Loop

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Your Mission

Start an autonomous Ralph loop that executes a PRP plan iteratively until all validations pass.

**Core Philosophy**: Self-referential feedback loop. Each iteration, you see your previous work in files and git history. You implement, validate, fix, repeat - until complete.

---

## Phase 1: PARSE - Validate Input

### 1.1 Parse Arguments

Extract from input:

- **File path**: Must end in `.plan.md` or `.prd.md`
- **Max iterations**: `--max-iterations N` (default: 20)

### 1.2 Validate Input Type

| Input                | Action                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Ends with `.plan.md` | Valid - use as plan file       |
| Ends with `.prd.md`  | Valid - will select next phase |
| Free-form text       | STOP with message below        |
| No input             | STOP with message below        |

**If invalid input:**

```
Ralph requires a PRP plan or PRD file.

Create one first:
  /prp-plan "your feature description"   # Creates plan from description
  /prp-prd "your product idea"           # Creates PRD with phases

Then run:
  /prp-ralph .claude/PRPs/plans/your-feature.plan.md --max-iterations 20
```

### 1.3 Verify File Exists

```bash
test -f "{file_path}" && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

**If NOT_FOUND**: Stop with error message.

### 1.4 If PRD File - Select Next Phase

If input is a `.prd.md` file:

1. Read the PRD
2. Parse Implementation Phases table
3. Find first phase with `Status: pending` where dependencies are `complete`
4. Report which phase will be executed
5. Note: The loop will create and execute a plan for this phase

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Input parsed (file path + max iterations)
- [ ] File exists and is valid type
- [ ] If PRD: next phase identified

---

## Phase 2: SETUP - Initialize Ralph Loop

### 2.1 Create State File

Create `.claude/prp-ralph.state.md`:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude
```

Write state file with this structure:

```markdown
---
active: true
iteration: 1
max_iterations: { N }
plan_path: '{file_path}'
input_type: '{plan|prd}'
started_at: '{ISO timestamp}'
---

# PRP Ralph Loop State

## Current Task

Execute PRP plan and iterate until all validations pass.

## Plan Reference

{file_path}

## Instructions

1. Read the plan file
2. Implement all incomplete tasks
3. Run ALL validation commands from the plan
4. If any validation fails: fix and re-validate
5. Update plan file: mark completed tasks, add notes
6. When ALL validations pass: output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

## Progress Log

(Append learnings after each iteration)
```

### 2.2 Display Startup Message

```markdown
## PRP Ralph Loop Activated

**Plan**: {file_path}
**Iteration**: 1
**Max iterations**: {N}

The stop hook is now active. When you try to exit:

- If validations incomplete → same prompt fed back
- If all validations pass → loop exits

To monitor: `cat .claude/prp-ralph.state.md`
To cancel: `/prp-ralph-cancel`

---

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Work through ALL tasks in the plan
- Run ALL validation commands
- Fix failures before proceeding
- Only output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when ALL validations pass
- Do NOT lie to exit - the loop continues until genuinely complete

---

Starting iteration 1...
```

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] State file created
- [ ] Startup message displayed

---

## Phase 3: EXECUTE - Work on Plan

### 3.1 Read the Plan

Read the plan file referenced in state.

### 3.2 Identify Work

From the plan, identify:

- Tasks not yet completed
- Validation commands to run
- Acceptance criteria to meet

### 3.3 Implement

For each incomplete task:

1. Read the task requirements
2. Read any MIRROR/pattern references
3. Implement the change
4. Run task-specific validation if specified

### 3.4 Validate

Run ALL validation commands from the plan:

```bash
# Typical validation levels (adapt to plan)
bun run type-check || npm run type-check
bun run lint || npm run lint
bun test || npm test
bun run build || npm run build
```

### 3.5 Track Results

| Check      | Result    | Notes     |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| Type check | PASS/FAIL | {details} |
| Lint       | PASS/FAIL | {details} |
| Tests      | PASS/FAIL | {details} |
| Build      | PASS/FAIL | {details} |

### 3.6 If Any Validation Fails

1. Analyze the failure
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run validation
4. Repeat until passing

### 3.7 Update Plan File

After each significant change:

- Mark completed tasks with checkboxes
- Add notes about what was done
- Document any deviations

### 3.8 Update State File

Append to Progress Log section:

```markdown
### Iteration {N} - {timestamp}

- Completed: {task summaries}
- Validation: {results}
- Issues fixed: {list}
- Learnings: {patterns discovered, gotchas encountered}
```

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] All tasks attempted
- [ ] All validations run
- [ ] Plan file updated
- [ ] State file updated

---

## Phase 4: COMPLETION CHECK

### 4.1 Verify All Validations Pass

ALL of these must be true:

- [ ] All tasks in plan completed
- [ ] Type check passes
- [ ] Lint passes (0 errors)
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met

### 4.2 If ALL Pass - Complete the Loop

1. **Generate Implementation Report**

   Create `.claude/PRPs/reports/{plan-name}-report.md`:

   ```markdown
   # Implementation Report

   **Plan**: {plan_path}
   **Completed**: {timestamp}
   **Iterations**: {N}

   ## Summary

   {What was implemented}

   ## Tasks Completed

   {List from plan}

   ## Validation Results

   | Check      | Result |
   | ---------- | ------ |
   | Type check | PASS   |
   | Lint       | PASS   |
   | Tests      | PASS   |
   | Build      | PASS   |

   ## Learnings

   {Consolidated from state file progress log}

   ## Deviations from Plan

   {Any changes made}
   ```

2. **Archive Plan**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/PRPs/plans/completed
   mv {plan_path} .claude/PRPs/plans/completed/
   ```

3. **Clean Up State**

   ```bash
   rm .claude/prp-ralph.state.md
   ```

4. **Output Completion Promise**

   ```
   <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
   ```

### 4.3 If NOT All Pass - End Iteration

If validations are not all passing:

- Document current state in progress log
- End your response normally
- The stop hook will feed the prompt back for next iteration

**Do NOT output the completion promise if validations are failing.**

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### Max Iterations Reached

If iteration count reaches max_iterations:

- Document what's incomplete
- Document what's blocking
- Suggest next steps
- Loop will exit automatically (stop hook handles this)

### Stuck on Same Issue

If you notice you're stuck:

- Document the blocker clearly in progress log
- Try alternative approaches
- If truly stuck, document for human review

### Plan Has Errors

If the plan itself has issues:

- Document the problems
- Suggest corrections
- Continue with what's executable

---

## Success Criteria

- **PLAN_EXECUTED**: All tasks from plan completed
- **VALIDATIONS_PASS**: All validation commands succeed
- **REPORT_GENERATED**: Implementation report created
- **LEARNINGS_CAPTURED**: Progress log has useful insights
- **CLEAN_EXIT**: Completion promise output only when genuinely complete
